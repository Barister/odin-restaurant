# The Odin Restaurant

### The Full Stack Curriculum Project to try Webpack

This is an educational project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) FullStack JavaScript curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a simple multipage restaurant site using Webpack bundler with modular code structure.

### Features

- **Modular JavaScript**: The project uses ES6 modules to separate the code into logical parts, making it more maintainable.
- **Single Page Application (SPA) Structure**: The webpage dynamically loads content without reloading the entire page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Minimalist UI**: The design focuses on simplicity and clarity.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling the page with a focus on responsiveness and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Dynamic content rendering and page functionality.
- **Webpack**: Used for bundling modules and assets during development.
